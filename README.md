# Hobby-Projects
Python projects I made in my own time to test myself. All created without AI and completely unguided.

Beginner Project #1 <br>
* [Word Processor](https://github.com/shrimponomicon/Py-Word-Processor) <br>
A refresher on sets, dictionaries, lists, and strings and their methods. Uses file IO to process any '.txt' file.
